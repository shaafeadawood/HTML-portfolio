# HTML-portfolio
This is a simple HTML portfolio website showcasing my projects as a full-stack web developer. It includes links to projects like a movie ranking and birthday invite, with sections for "About Me" and "Contact Me". This project highlights my ability to create clean, responsive webpages using basic HTML elements.
